RotaryControl
=============

RotaryControl started as a learning project for making a custom circular control.  The RotaryControlView class is a custom view that gives you the ability to change the dial's look (color & size), it's range of values, and allows you to animate a percentage change.

The project here will create 2 rotary controls that are linked together, with one ranging from 0-100 and the other 0-255.

The demo view was created for the iPhone 5 :)
