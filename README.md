RotaryControl
=============

RotaryControl started as a learning project for making a custom circular control.  The RotaryControlView class is a custom view that gives you the ability to customize on how the dial looks, it's range of values, and allows you to animate a percentage change.

The project here will create 2 rotary controls that are linked together, one ranging from 0-100, the other 0-255.  The demo view was created for the iPhone 5 :)
